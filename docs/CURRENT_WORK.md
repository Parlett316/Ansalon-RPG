# Current work

Nothing in flight.

Milestone 103 (2026-08-27) gave the level-3 Mage "Test of High Sorcery"
flavor moment three distinct outcome passages (White/Red/Black), replacing
the single generic templated line every Robe used to share -- sourced from
rendered DLA p.33-37 page images, each passage dramatizing a different
named Test guideline from the book (unsolvable-by-magic trial, combat
against an ally, the Red Robe's defining "balance" identity). Pure flavor
text in `character::applyPendingLevelUps` (`Leveling.cpp`), no new fields
or save-format changes. Verified via a clean `/W4` rebuild and the piped
smoke test (the user's real save loaded untouched); no throwaway self-test
needed. **Interactive verification still needed** -- a Mage reaching level
3 under each of the three alignment groups to see all three new passages.
See `docs/MILESTONES.md` entry 103 and `docs/CHARACTER_NOTES.md`'s
"Wizards of High Sorcery".

Milestone 102 (2026-08-26) also still has its own interactive
verification outstanding -- buying Studded Leather/Plate Mail at the
shops that should carry them, equipping the Mage's Quarterstaff and the
Tinker's Light Crossbow, and finding/accepting/completing
`seed_for_thorbardin` at Haven and Thorbardin. See `docs/MILESTONES.md`
entry 102.
